# Lymphovid19

1) Bulk repertoire sequencing data preprocessed with MiXCR
2) 3 Files per sample combined. For each sample, cloneFraction divided by the number of files and summed.
3) Only CDR3s with length between 3 and 25 are included.
4) IGLs, IGHs, IGKs are discarded.
5) Only sequences presenting functional V and J genes are kept (IMGT.org website).
6) This data was fed to TCRex for binding predictions for Covid-specific epitopes.
